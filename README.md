In this project, we will be
building a User Management 
System using the useContext
hook in React. This project
is designed for advanced 
coders who already have a
good understanding of React
and want to explore the
useContext hook for managing 
state and sharing data across
components.

Step 1: Set up your React project

- Create a new React project using
your preferred method
(e.g., Create React App).
- Set up the necessary folder
structure and files for your project.

Step 2: Define the UserContext

- Create a new file called
"UserContext.js" to define
your UserContext.
- Import the createContext
function from the 'react' package.
- Use createContext to create
a UserContext object.

Step 3: Create the UserProvider

- Create a new file called
"UserProvider.js" to define
the UserProvider component.
- Import the UserContext object
from the "UserContext.js" file.
- Create a functional component
called UserProvider.
- Inside the UserProvider component,
create a state using useState
to manage user data.
- Wrap the children components
with the UserContext.Provider
component and pass the user
data as a value prop.

Step 4: Access the UserContext

- Import the UserContext object
into any component where you 
want to access the user data.
- Use the useContext hook to access
the user data from the UserContext.

Step 5: Update the UserContext

- Create functions within the 
UserProvider component to
update the user data.
- These functions should update
the state using the useState hook.
- Provide these functions as part
of the value prop in the
UserContext.Provider component.

Step 6: Implement User Management
System functionality

- Design and create components for
user registration, login, and
profile management.
- Use the UserContext to share user
data across these components.
- Implement functionality to update
user information, change passwords,
and perform other user-related actions.

Step 7: Test and refine the User
Management System

- Test your User Management System
by interacting with the components.
- Verify that the user data is
correctly shared across the
components using the UserContext.
- Make any necessary improvements
or bug fixes to ensure smooth
functionality.
